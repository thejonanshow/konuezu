# Live Pairing on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/thejonanshow)

### Hi! I'm Jonan ðŸ‘‹

![round-avatar-360](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/270746/41746508-7a1167f8-755f-11e8-92f4-44e47baf89bd.png)

I'm a Developer Advocate at [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and I spend a lot of time hanging out at software conferences. Sometimes I talk developers into pair programming with me on Conway's Game of Life, these are the artifacts of those adventures.

My hope is that seeing developers struggle to build their solutions and have fun learning together is inspirational for our viewers.

The point of this exercise is definitely not to "win" or build the best version of the game as quickly as possible. It serves more as a vehicle to discuss software development generally, and to reassure ourselves collectively that our peers are, in fact, fallible humans.

As such many of the examples you see here will be broken, and they may not make sense without the videos to accompany them.

You can find the most recent pairing sessions on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/thejonanshow).

Videos fall off of Twitch after a couple of months, so I will move them over to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/jonanscheffler) as I get time.

If you're only interested in the very freshest artisanal handcrafted pairing videos, you would be wise to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thejonanshow). I mostly almost always remember to tweet when I'm about to start streaming.

Thanks for watching!

ðŸ’œ Jonan
